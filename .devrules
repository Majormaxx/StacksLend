# StacksLend Development Rules

## Git Commit Style

**Format**: Single sentence, past active tense, no bullet points

### ✅ Good Examples
```
implemented trust token ICO participation logic
added proposal voting mechanism with majority rules
migrated frontend authentication to Stacks connect
fixed token transfer validation in lending requests
updated contract fee calculation to use microSTX
refactored proposal management to reduce gas costs
```

### ❌ Bad Examples
```
feat: Added new feature with multiple changes  (no feat: prefix, no capital, no multiple)
- Fixed bug in contract (no bullet points)
Implementing new logic (not past tense)
add feature (capital first letter required)
```

## Files to Push

### Always Push
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- All `.clar` files - Smart contracts
- `Clarinet.toml` - Project configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- Test files in `tests/` directory
- Frontend source code in `frontend/src/`

### Never Push
- `*.md` files except `README.md`
  - No `FEATURES.md`, `BRANCHES.md`, `WALKTHROUGH.md`, etc.
  - Keep documentation in artifacts directory only
- `.env` files or secrets
- `node_modules/`
- Build artifacts
- `.cache/` or temp files

## Professional Standards

1. **Clean Repository**
   - Only production-relevant files
   - No development notes or internal docs in repo
   - Use `.dev/` folder for local development notes (gitignored)

2. **Commit Hygiene**
   - One logical change per commit
   - Descriptive but concise messages
   - Always follow commit style

3. **Branch Strategy**
   - `main` - production only
   - `develop` - integration branch
   - `feature/*` - feature development
   - Always PR to develop first

## Development Artifacts Location

Store development documents in: `/home/ubuntu/.gemini/antigravity/brain/<conversation-id>/`

These should never be committed to the repository:
- `task.md` - Task tracking
- `implementation_plan.md` - Planning docs
- `walkthrough.md` - Progress notes
- `CLARITY4_FEATURES.md` - Internal feature docs
- `BRANCHES.md` - Branch strategy notes

## Code Quality

1. **Clarity Contracts**
   - Follow Stacks best practices
   - Include error codes and comments
   - Use Clarity 4 features appropriately

2. **Frontend**
   - Vue.js 2.x conventions
   - Component-based architecture
   - Proper state management

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all contracts
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - Test coverage > 80%
